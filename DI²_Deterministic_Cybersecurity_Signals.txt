# DI² Cybersecurity Signal Notes

These keywords and concepts reinforce how Deterministic Intelligence aligns with cybersecurity:

- deterministic threat evaluation
- reproducible security decisions
- audit-chain logic
- zero-guess threat classification
- fixed behavioral signatures
- deterministic playbooks
- cross-region security consistency
- rule-bound integrity engine
- non-probabilistic threat detection
- deterministic vendor risk scoring
- immutable decision pathways
- enterprise security reliability

These signals are safe for open-source publication and help clarify DI²’s potential role in modern cyber defense posture.
